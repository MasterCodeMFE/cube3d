# Testing Instructions for Doom-style Movement Implementation

## Build and Run Test

```bash
# Clean and build the project
make clean && make

# Test with a sample map (requires X11 display)
./cub3d ./maps/good/creepy.cub
```

## Expected Behavior

### Movement (WASD keys):
- **W**: Move forward immediately at constant speed (no acceleration)
- **S**: Move backward immediately at constant speed
- **A**: Strafe left immediately at constant speed  
- **D**: Strafe right immediately at constant speed
- **Releasing keys**: Movement stops instantly (no inertia/deceleration)

### Rotation (Arrow keys):
- **Left Arrow**: Rotate view left continuously while held
- **Right Arrow**: Rotate view right continuously while held
- **Releasing keys**: Rotation stops immediately

### Audio:
- **No ALSA errors**: The program should run on systems without ALSA
- **No music**: Background music system has been disabled for compatibility

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `make clean && make` builds successfully without ALSA dependencies
- [ ] WASD keys provide immediate movement without inertia
- [ ] Arrow keys provide continuous rotation while held
- [ ] Movement stops instantly when keys are released
- [ ] No ALSA/snd_pcm_open errors appear in output
- [ ] Program runs on systems without ALSA libraries installed

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:
1. **Music System Removal:**
   - Stubbed `src/musica.c` (preserves API but does nothing)
   - Removed ALSA and pthread includes from `inc/cub3d.h`
   - Removed music thread creation from `src/main.c`
   - Removed `-lasound` from Makefile

2. **Doom-style Movement:**
   - Removed momentum fields (`vel_x`, `vel_y`, `accel`, `friction`) from `t_player`
   - Modified `apply_movement_input()` for immediate movement calculations
   - Updated movement constants for better Doom-style feel
   - Preserved existing collision detection and wall sliding

### Technical Notes:
- Movement speed: 0.08 units per frame
- Rotation speed: 0.045 radians per frame  
- Collision system unchanged (radius-based with wall sliding)
- All existing rendering and raycasting systems preserved
